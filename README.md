# Usage Notice
- The chest can carry by any team member, but cannot be removed from the team, and all the real player a count as one team in multiplayer games. Also the chest it self can add to wares but you can't sell it at all :\)
- The item in the chest is a **dummy item**, which has **zero weight**(*the visual weight value is not **refreshed** only you pick something up or loading scenes and the weight value of the character only **refreshed** when loading scenes*), **zero value** and **cannot be used**.
- When you put an item into the chest, the chest will create the dummy item and give you back your original one(it will always place into the chest owner).
- From 1.0.28, stack items will automatically reduce to only one item in the chest, because stack item can do cheat.
- **Beware** Drag an item not from chest holder's inventory and put on the chest icon will not work, it will place into holder's inventory not the chest. This is the default behavior to all container without any mods.
- Non-items(like corpse), golds, story items(like Eldritch Rune with orange border) cannot put into the chest.
- **Not test with any other mods yet. Please make sure you backup your saves. Platform Other than windows is not tested either, but should work as client**
